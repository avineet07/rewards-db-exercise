This repo is the solution for the assignment of Rewards Data into Database and answering analytics questions
How to read the solution

The final answers have been summarized in 2 files

1. Entity relationship diagram in the 'relationship-diagram' folder
2. Answers 2-3-4.pdf containing the rest of the answers

The full working has been carried out using the Python Programming language and SQL using Jupyter notebooks. The SQL syntax is conformant to the SQL syntax accepted in sqlite3 python library. Most notable differences would be in unnesting the arrays in the tables. There are 2 scripts in the data folder (along with the data files being used):

1. table creation script: this contains the python code and SQL queries for creating a data warehouse like architecture, consisting of tables made from json files
Note: if you want to run the full script without errors, delete the datalake.db file and run the script.
2. Analysis script: this contains the Python and SQL code for doing the analysis on the data modeled in first script.

Answers have been curated from the outputs of the scripts. 

Thanks!
